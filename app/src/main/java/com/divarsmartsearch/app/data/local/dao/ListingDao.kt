     * another stored number (e.g. "0912345678" matching inside
     * "09123456789,..."), and got *more* likely to misfire the longer the
     * app had been running and the more numbers had accumulated. A repeated
     * phone number nudges OwnerDetector's agency-probability score up, so
     * even one such false match was enough to tip a perfectly fine,
     * unique-numbered listing over the 50% cutoff and make it disappear.
     * Every branch below only matches :phone as a whole comma-delimited token.
